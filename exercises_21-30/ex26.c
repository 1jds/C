// 26. Print all even numbers between 1 and 50
//
// Write a C program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
// Test Data :
// Even numbers between 1 to 50 (inclusive):
// Expected Output:
// 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50
//
// NOTES: This is an interesting problem, because it can be all hard-coded. Of course,
// we could take the moduls with % to check if a number is even, and maybe use a for
// loop. But to satisfy the exact requirements here, we can just print the list given!
